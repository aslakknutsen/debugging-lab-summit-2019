== "You Are Not Alone"

_15 MINUTES PRACTICE_

image:{% image_path castaway.jpg  %}[Cast Away, 500]

After a long and frustrated morning spending hours to solve an issue that a colleague, passing by chance with his/her 
cup of coffee, fixed in literally 5 seconds, you are finally ready to start your normal working day when ...

Your manager suddenly comes out of his/her office and walks to you with the very known face that saying *"You are in trouble!"*.
Indeed, the new release of a ***Mysterious Application*** is planned for tonight (everything is always urgent) and it seems to contain some bugs.

And of course, the developer who worked on this last release is now drinking some mojitos on the paradise island and you are the 
only one available who can save the situation. Your manager points the source code https://github.com/mcouliba/cloud-native-labs/tree/debugging[Mysterious Application^] out, 
gives you a gentle tap on the shoulder and says "Bon Courage!".

At that moment in time, you feel like you are on an island, but not the same one than your colleague.

Now you have to:

* Identify the right tools to build and run the ***Mysterious Application***
* Install them on your environment
* Build your application which could be composed by several heterogeneous languages
* Test, deploy, run it
* ...

Piouf!! Lots of things to do in a short period of time...

*"No Worry Be Happy"*, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Inc is here to help!!

https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview/[Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces^] is a collaborative Kubernetes-native development 
platform that delivers OpenShift workspaces and an IDE for rapid cloud application development.

Built on the open Eclipse Che project, https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview/[Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces^] 
provides developer workspaces on OpenShift with all the tools and the dependencies that are needed to code, build, test, run, and 
debug containerized applications. The entire product runs in the cloud and eliminates the need to install anything on a local machine.

* It offers fast onboarding capabilities for teams with powerful collaboration, workspace automation, and management at scale
* It removes inconsistencies and the “works on my machine” syndrome
* It protects source code from the hard-to-secure developer and personal laptops

=== Getting your Developer Workspace with a single click

https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview/[Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces^] will provide you an out-of-box 
*Developer Workspace* with all the tools and the dependencies we need to do the job. **And with only one single click!**

First, `*go to https://github.com/mcouliba/cloud-native-labs/tree/debugging[Mysterious Application^]*`. The **README.md** file contains a 
link called ***"Developer Workspace"***. 

image:{% image_path developer-workspace-link.png  %}[Developer Workspace - Link, 800]

`*Click on it*` then `*login as {{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}*` and let's the magic happens...

image:{% image_path developer-workspace-build.png %}[Developer Workspace - Build, 600]

[NOTE]
.Factory
====
Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces uses a https://developers.redhat.com/crw-fmi#share_workspaces_with_factories[Factory^] to automate the provisioning 
of a specific workspace by using the **.factory.json** file in the GitHub repository.
Providing a **.factory.json** file inside the repository signals to CodeReady Workspaces URL factory to configure the project and runtime according 
to this configuration file.
====

Once completed, you will have a fully functional CodeReady Workspaces IDE running in your browser within the source code already imported.

=== Login to OpenShift

First, you need to connect {{ CODEREADY_WORKSPACES_URL }}[CodeReady Workspaces^] to the OpenShift cluster.
In {{ CODEREADY_WORKSPACES_URL }}[CodeReady Workspaces^], `*use the ***Commands Palette*** and click on 'OPENSHIFT > oc login'`*

image:{% image_path codeready-command-oc-login.png %}[oc login, 300]

[NOTE]
.Commands Palette Info
====
The command **oc login --server={{ OPENSHIFT_API_URL }}:6443** is issued using the credentials `{{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}`
====

You should get an output in the `oc login` ***Terminal Window of CodeReady Workspaces*** as following:

[source,shell]
----
Login successful.
 
You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':
 
  * {{ COOLSTORE_PROJECT }}
    {{ INFRA_PROJECT }}
 
Using project "{{ COOLSTORE_PROJECT }}".
Already on project "{{ COOLSTORE_PROJECT }}" on server "{{ OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL }}:443".
-----------
Successful Connected to OpenShift as {{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}
-----------

=== Build and Deploy the Mysterious Application

Once logged, you can build and deploy the application to debug  on OpenShift.
In CodeReady Workspaces, use the ***Commands Palette***  and **click on BUILD > Build Mysterious Application**

image:{% image_path codeready-command-build-app.png %}[Build App, 300]

[NOTE]
.Commands Palette Info
====
First, the `*oc create*` command creates a list of objects defining the application. 
Then, the `*oc start-build*` commands build container images of all microservices from the local source code and deploy them on OpenShift.

This operation could take 5-10 minutes. Please, be patient :-)
====

You can observe the build and deployment progress from the {{ OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL }}[OpenShift Web Console^].

`*Access to the {{ OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL }}[OpenShift Web Console^]*`. The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. 

`*Enter your username and password ({{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }})*` and then log in. After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with.

`*Click on the {{ COOLSTORE_PROJECT }} project*` to be taken to the project overview page
which will list all resources composing your project.

In the left navigation menu, `*click on 'Workloads > Pods'*` to be taken to the pods overview page
which will list all pods that you have running as part of your project.

Once successfully built, deployed and runned on Openshift, the **6 pods** of your application should be **Running** and **Ready** as following:

image:{% image_path openshift-console-pods-1.png%}[Openshift Console, 700]
image:{% image_path openshift-console-pods-2.png%}[Openshift Console, 700]

`*Point your browser at the following application URL, http://{{ COOLSTORE_PROJECT }}.{{ APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX }}[http://{{ COOLSTORE_PROJECT }}.{{ APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX }}^]*`. 
You should be able to see the Mysterious Application up and running.
